# adkiller
Aplication for killing (muting) the advertisement in internet radio stream. Its simply comparing the buffered sound with ad's jingle pattern, and notify the user about it. If an ad is detected, then the application mutes the sound and looks for the end jingle to show up.

UI is very poor. The radio station configuration is in Data/radiostations.xml. Start and end jingle is needed ( Can be obtained using audacity. Just remember to save it with proper frequency).

Pretty old code ( from 2014 ) which I don't plan to clean/update. Feel free to use :)
